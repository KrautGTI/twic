The Wind did'nt come from the Orchard - today -
Further than that -
Nor stop to play with the Hay -
Nor threaten a Hat -
He's a transitive fellow - very -
Rely on that -
If He leave a Bur at the door
We know He has climbed a Fir -
But the Fir is Where - Declare -
Were you ever there?
If He bring Odors of Clovers -
And that is His business - not Our's -
Then He has been with the Mowers -
Whetting away the Hours
To sweet pauses of Hay -
His Way - of a June Day -
If He fling Sand, and Pebble -
Little Hats - and stubble -
With an occasional steeple -
And a hoarse "Get out of the Way, I say",
Who'd be the fool to stay?
Would you - Say -
Would you be the fool to stay?
