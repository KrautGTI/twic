Safe in their Alabaster Chambers,
Untouched by morning -
And untouched by noon -
Lie the meek members of the Resurrection -
Rafter of satin - and Roof of stone -
Grand go the Years - in the Crescent - above them -
Worlds scoop their Arcs -
And Firmaments - row -
Diadems - drop - and Doges - surrender -
Soundless as dots - on a Disc of snow -
