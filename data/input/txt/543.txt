The Grass so little has to do,
A Sphere of simple Green -
With only Butterflies, to brood,
And Bees, to entertain -
And stir all day to pretty tunes
The Breezes fetch along,
And hold the Sunshine, in it's lap
And bow to everything,
And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearl,
And make itself so fine
A Duchess, were too common
For such a noticing,
And even when it die, to pass
In odors so divine -
As lowly spices, gone to sleep -
Or Amulets of Pine -
And then to dwell in Sovreign Barns,
And dream the Days away,
The Grass so little has to do,
I wish I were a Hay -
