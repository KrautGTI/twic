"Nature" is what We see -
The Hill - the Afternoon -
Squirrel - Eclipse - the Bumble bee -
Nay - Nature is Heaven -
"Nature" is what We hear -
The Bobolink - the Sea -
Thunder - the Cricket -
Nay - Nature is Harmony -
"Nature" is what We know -
But have no Art to say -
So impotent our Wisdom is
To Her Sincerity -
