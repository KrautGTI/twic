Proud of my broken heart, since thou break it,
Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,
Proud of my night, since thou with moons dost slake it,
to partake thy passion, humility.
Thou can'st not boast, like Jesus, drunken without
Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene
Thou can'st not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture,
See! I usurped crucifix to honor mine!
