Two Butterflies went out at Noon -
And waltzed opon a Farm -
Then stepped straight through the Firmament
And rested, on a Beam -
And then - together bore away
Opon a shining Sea -
Though never yet, in any Port -
Their coming, mentioned - be -
If spoken by the distant Bird -
If met in Ether Sea
By Frigate, or by Merchantman -
No notice - was - to me -
