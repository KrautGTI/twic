I Came to buy a smile - today -
But just a single smile -
The smallest one opon your face
Will suit me just as well -
The one that no one else would miss
It shone so very small -
I'm pleading at the "counter" - Sir -
Could you afford to sell -
I've - on my fingers -
You know what  are?
I've Rubies - like the Evening Blood -
And Topaz - like the star!
'Twould be "a Bargain" for a
- May I have it - Sir?
