Good Night - Which put the Candle Out?
A jealous Zephyr - not a doubt -
Ah, friend, You little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The Angels - labored diligent -
Extinguished - now - for You -
It might have been the Light House Spark -
Some Sailor - rowing in the Dark -
Had importuned to see -
It might have been the waning Lamp
That lit the Drummer - from the Camp -
To purer Reveille -
