Knows how to forget!
But could It teach it?
Easiest of Arts, they say
When one learn how
Dull Hearts have died
In the Acquisition
Sacrifice for Science
Is common, though, now --
I went to School
But was not wiser
Globe did not teach it
Nor Logarithm Show
"How to forget"!
Say -- some -- Philosopher!
Ah, to be erudite
Enough to know!
Is it in a Book?
So, I could buy it --
Is it like a Planet?
Telescopes would know --
If it be invention
It must have a Patent.
Rabbi of the Wise Book
