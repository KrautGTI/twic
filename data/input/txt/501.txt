I showed her Hights she never saw -
"Would'st Climb," I said?
She said - "Not so" -
"With -" I said - With
I showed her Secrets - Morning's Nest -
The Rope the Nights were put across -
And - "Would'st have me for a Guest"?
She could not find her Yes -
And then, I brake my life - And Lo,
A Light, for her, did solemn glow,
The larger, as her face withdrew -
And she, further, "No"?
