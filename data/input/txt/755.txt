The One that could repeat the Summer Day -
Were Greater than Itself - though He -
Minutest of Mankind - should be -
And He - could reproduce the Sun -
At Period of Going down -
The Lingering - and the Stain - I mean -
When Orient - have been outgrown -
And Occident - become Unknown -
His Name - Remain -
