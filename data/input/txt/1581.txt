We like March - his Shoes are Purple -
He is new and high -
Makes he Mud for Dog and Peddler -
Makes he Forest dry -
Knows the Adder's Tongue his coming
And begets her Spot -
Stands the Sun so close and mighty
That our Minds are hot -
News is he of all the others -
Bold it were to die
With the Blue Birds buccaneering
On his British Sky -
