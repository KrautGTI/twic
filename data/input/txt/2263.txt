A Drunkard cannot meet a Cork
Without a Revery -
And so encountering a Fly
This January Day
Jamaicas of Remembrance stir
That send me reeling in -
The moderate drinker of Delight
Does not deserve the Spring -
Of Juleps, part are in the Jug
And more are in the Joy -
Your connoisaeur in Liquors consults the Bumble Bee -
