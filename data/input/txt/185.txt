Safe in their Alabaster chambers -
Untouched by Morning -
And untouched by Noon -
Lie the meek members of the Resurrection -
Rafter of Satin - and Roof of Stone!
Springs - shake the seals -
But the silence - stiffens -
Frost unhook - in the  Northern Zones -
Icicles - crawl from polar  Caverns -
Midnight in Marble -
Refutes - the Suns -
