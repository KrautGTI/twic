Through the Straight Pass of Suffering
The Martyrs even trod -
Their feet opon Temptation -
Their foreheads - opon God -
A Stately - Shriven Company -
Convulsion playing round -
Harmless as Streaks of Meteor -
Opon a Planet's Bond -
Their faith the Everlasting Troth -
Their Expectation - sure -
The Needle to the North Degree
Wades so - through Polar Air -
