One Sister have I in the house -
And one a hedge away.
There's only one recorded -
But both belong to me.
One came the road that I
And wore my last year's gown -
The other, as a bird her nest
Builded our hearts among.
She did not sing as we
It was
Herself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.
Today is far from childhood,
But up and down the hills,
I held her

And still her hum
The years among,
Deceives the Butterfly;
And in her Eye
The Violets lie,
Mouldered this many May
I spilt the dew,
But took the morn -
I chose this single star
From out the wide night's numbers -
Sue - forevermore!
