The mushroom is the Elf of Plants -
At Evening it is not -
At Morning in a truffled Hut
It stop  opon a Spot
As if it tarried always
And yet it's whole career
Is shorter than a Snake's delay
And fleeter than a Tare -
'Tis Vegetation's Juggler -
The Joy of Alibi -
Doth like a Bubble antedate
And like a Bubble hie -
I feel as if the Grass  was pleased
To have it intermit -
This surreptitious Scion
Of Summers Circumspect
Had Nature any outcast Face -
Could she a Son contemn -
Had Nature an Iscariot,
That Mushroom - it is him -
