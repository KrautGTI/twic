Could live - live -
Could die - die -
Could smile opon the whole
faith in one he met not -
To introduce his soul -
Could go from scene familiar
To an untraversed spot -
Could contemplate the journey
With unpuzzled heart -
Such trust had one among us -
Among us today -
We who saw the launching
Never sailed the Bay!
