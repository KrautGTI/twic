The robin is a Gabriel
In humble circumstances
His dress denotes him socially
Of transport's working classes -
He has the punctuality
Of the New England farmer
The same oblique integrity
A vista - vastly warmer.
A small, but sturdy residence
A self denying household
The guests of perspicacity
Are all that cross his threshold
As covert as a fugitive
Cajoling consternation
By ditties to the enemy
And silvan punctuation -
