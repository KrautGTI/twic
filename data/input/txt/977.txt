The Moon was but a Chin of Gold
A night or two ago -
And now she turns Her perfect Face
Opon the World below -
Her Forehead is of Amplest Blonde -
Her Cheek - a Beryl hewn -
Her Eye unto the Summer Dew
The likest I have known -
Her Lips of Amber never part -
But what must be the smile
Opon Her Friend she could  confer
Were such Her silver will -
And what a privilege to be
But the remotest star -
For Certainty she take Her way
Beside Your Palace Door -
Her Bonnet is the Firmament -
The Universe - Her shoe -
The Stars - the Trinkets at Her Belt -
Her Dimities - of Blue -
