of so much consequence!
Yet I - for it - would pay -
My soul's -
In ceaseless - salary -
- to me - so signal -
That I would instant dive -
Although - I - to it -
Would me -
The Sea is full - I know it!
That - does not blur
It burns - distinct from all the row -
-
The life is thick - I know it!
Yet - not so dense a crowd -
But - are -
Far down the dustiest Road!
