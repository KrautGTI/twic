What would I give to see his face?
I'd give -- I'd give my life -- of course --
But that is not enough!
Stop just a minute -- let me think!
I'd give my biggest Bobolink!
That makes two -- Him -- and Life!
You know who "June" is --
I'd give her --
Roses a day from Zenzibar --
And Lily tubes -- like Wells --
Bees -- by the furlong --
Straits of Blue
Navies of Butterflies -- sailed thro' --
And dappled Cowslip Dells
Then I have "shares" in Primrose "Banks" --
Daffodil Dowries -- spicy "Stocks" --
Dominions -- broad as Dew --
Bags of Doubloons -- adventurous Bees
Brought me -- from firmamental seas --
And Purple -- from Peru --
Now -- have I bought it --
"Shylock"? Say!
Sign me the Bond!
"I vow to pay
To Her -- who pledges this --
One hour -- of her Sovreign's face"!
Extatic Contract!
Niggard Grace!
My Kingdom's worth of Bliss!
