As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed away -
Too imperceptible at last
To feel like Perfidy -
A Quietness distilled
As Twilight long begun
Or Nature spending with Herself
Sequestered Afternoon -
The Dusk drew earlier in
The Morning foreign shone
A Courteous, yet harrowing Grace
As Guest who would be gone -
And thus, without a Wing
Or service of a keel
Our Summer made her light escape
Into the Beautiful.
