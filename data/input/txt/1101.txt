The luxury to apprehend
The luxury 'twould be
To look at thee a single time
An Epicure of Me
In whatsoever Presence makes
Till for a further food
I scarcely recollect to starve
So first am I supplied -
The luxury to meditate
The luxury it was
To banquet on thy Countenance
A Sumptuousness bestows
On plainer Days,
Whose Table, far
As Certainty - can see -
Is laden with a single Crumb -
The Consciousness - of Thee -
