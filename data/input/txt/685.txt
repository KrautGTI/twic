The Day undressed - Herself -
Her Garter - was of Gold -
Her Petticoat of Purple - just -
Her Dimities as old
Exactly - as the World
And yet the newest Star
Enrolled opon the Hemisphere -
Be wrinkled - much as Her -
Too near to God - to pray -
Too near to Heaven - to fear -
The Lady of the Occident
Retired without a Care -
Her Candle so expire
The Flickering be seen
On Ball of Mast - in Foreign Port -
And Spire - and Window Pane.
