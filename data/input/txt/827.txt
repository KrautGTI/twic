Her - last Poems -
Poets ended -
Silver - perished - with her Tongue -
Not on Record - bubbled Other -
Flute - or Woman - so divine -
Not unto it's Summer Morning -
Robin - uttered half the Tune
Gushed too full for the adoring -
From the Anglo-Florentine -
Late - the Praise - 'Tis dull - Conferring
On the Head too High - to Crown -
Diadem - or Ducal symbol -
Be it's Grave - sufficient Sign -
Nought - that We - No Poet's Kinsman -
Suffocate - with easy Wo -
What - and if Ourself a Bridegroom -
Put Her down - in Italy?
