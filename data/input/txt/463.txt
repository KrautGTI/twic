She sweeps with many-colored Brooms -
And leaves the shreds behind -
Oh Housewife in the Evening West -
Come back - and dust the Pond -
You dropped a Purple Ravelling in -
You dropped an Amber Thread -
And now you've littered all the East
With Duds of Emerald -
And still she plies Her spotted thrift
And still the scene prevails
Till Dusk obstructs the Diligence -
Or Contemplation fails.
