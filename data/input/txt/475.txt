There came a Day - at Summer's full -
Entirely for me -
I thought that such - were for the Saints -
When Resurrections - be -
The Sun - as common - went abroad -
The Flowers - accustomed - blew -
Solstice passed -
maketh all things new.
The time was scarce profaned - by speech -
The of a word
Was needless - as at Sacrament -
The Wardrobe - of Our Lord -
Each was to each - the sealed church -
Permitted to commune - this time -
Lest we too awkward - show -
At "Supper of the Lamb."
The hours slid fast - as hours will -
Clutched tight - by greedy hands -
So - faces on two Decks - look back -
Bound to opposing Lands -
And so - when all the time had -
Without external sound -
Each - bound the other's Crucifix -
We gave no other bond -
Sufficient troth - that we shall rise -
Deposed - at length - the Grave -
To that New Marriage -
Justified - through Calvaries of Love!
