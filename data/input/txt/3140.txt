Each Life Converges to some Centre --
Expressed -- or still --
Exists in every Human Nature
A Goal --
Embodied scarcely to itself -- it may be --
Too fair
For Credibility's presumption
To mar --
Adored with caution -- as a Brittle Heaven --
To reach
Were hopeless, as the Rainbow's Raiment
To touch --
Yet persevered toward -- surer -- for the Distance --
How high --
Unto the Saints' slow diligence --
The Sky --
Ungained -- it may be -- by a Life's low Venture
But then --
Eternity enable the endeavoring
Again.
