My Reward for Being - was this -
My Premium - My Bliss -
An Admiralty, less -
A Sceptre - penniless -
And Realms - just Dross -
When Thrones - accost my Hands -
With "Me - Miss - Me" -
I'll unroll - Thee -
Sufficient Dynasty -
Creation - powerless -
To Peer this Grace -
Empire - State -
Too little - Dust -
To Dower - so Great -
