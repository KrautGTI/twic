Further in Summer than the Birds -
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
It's unobtrusive Mass -
No Ordinance be seen -
So gradual the Grace
A gentle Custom it becomes -
Enlarging Loneliness -
Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this Spectral Canticle
Repose to typify -
Remit as yet no Grace -
No furrow on the Glow -
But a Druidic Difference
Enhances Nature now -
