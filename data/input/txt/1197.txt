Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
It's unobtrusive Mass
No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness.
Antiquer felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify.
Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on the Glow
Yet a Druidic - Difference
Enhances Nature now
