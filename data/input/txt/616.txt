I never felt at Home - Below -
And in the Handsome skies
I shall not feel at Home - I know -
I dont like Paradise -
Because it's Sunday - all the time -
And Recess - never comes -
And Eden'll be so lonesome
Bright Wednesday Afternoons -
If God could make a visit -
Or ever took a Nap -
So not to see us - but they say
Himself - a Telescope
Perennial beholds us -
Myself would run away
From Him - and Holy Ghost - and all -
But there's the "Judgment Day"!
