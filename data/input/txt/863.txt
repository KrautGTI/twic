The Soul's Superior instants
Occur to Her - Alone -
When friend - and Earth's occasion
Have infinite withdrawn -
Or She - Herself - ascended
To too remote a Hight
For lower Recognition
Than Her Omnipotent -
This mortal Abolition
Is seldom - but as fair
As Apparition - subject
To Autocratic Air -
Eternity's disclosure
To a Revering - Eye
Of the Colossal substance
Of Immortality -
