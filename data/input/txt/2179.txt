The Bible is an untold volume,
Written by unknown men
At the request of hallowed spectres -
Subjects, Bethlehem,
Genesis, Bethlehem's ancestor,
Satan, the Brigadier,
Judas, the great Defaulter,
David, the Troubadour,
Sin, a distinguished precipice, -
But we must desist.
Boys that "believe" are very lonesome,
Other boys are "lost."
Had but the tale a warbling teller,
All the boys would come -
Orpheu's sermon captivated,
It did not condemn!
