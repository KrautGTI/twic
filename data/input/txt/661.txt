He fumbles at your Soul
As Players at the Keys -
Before they drop full Music on -
He stuns you by Degrees -
Prepares your brittle substance
For the etherial Blow
By fainter Hammers - further heard -
Then nearer - Then so - slow -
Your Breath - has chance to straighten -
Your Brain - to bubble cool -
Deals One - imperial Thunderbolt -
That peels your naked soul -
When Winds hold Forests in their Paws -
The Firmaments - are still -
