A Dew sufficed itself -
And satisfied a Leaf -
And thought "How vast a Destiny"!
"How trivial is Life"!
The Sun went out to work -
The Day went out to play -
But not again that Dew be seen
By Physiognomy -
Whether by Day abducted -
Or emptied by the Sun
Into the Sea - in passing -
Eternally unknown.
Attested to this Day
That awful Tragedy
By Transport's instability
And Doom's celerity.
