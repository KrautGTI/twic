As Summer into autumn slips
And yet we sooner say
"The Summer" than "the autumn" - lest
We turn the sun away -
And count it almost an affront
The presence to concede
Of one however lovely - not
The one that we have loved -
So we evade the charge of years
On one attempting shy
The circumvention of the shaft
Of Life's declivity.
