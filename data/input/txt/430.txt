It sifts from Leaden Sieves
It powders all the Wood
It fills with Alabaster Wool
The wrinkles of the Road -
It scatters like the Birds
Condenses like a Flock
Like Juggler's Flowers situates
Opon a Baseless Arc -
It traverses - yet halts -
Disperses, while it stays
Then curls itself in Capricorn
Denying that it was -
