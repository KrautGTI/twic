To learn the Transport by the Pain -
As Blind Men learn the sun!
To die of thirst - suspecting
That Brooks in Meadows run!
To stay the homesick - homesick feet
Opon a foreign shore -
Haunted by native lands, the while -
And blue - beloved Air!
This is the sovreign Anguish!
This - the signal wo!
These are the patient "Laureates"
Whose voices - trained - below -
Ascend in ceaseless Carol -
Inaudible, indeed,
To us - the duller scholars
Of the Mysterious Bard!
