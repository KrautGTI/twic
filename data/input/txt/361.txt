We - Bee and I - live by the quaffing -
'Tis'nt - with us -
Life has it's -
But it's many a lay of the Dim Burgundy -
We chant - for cheer - when the Wines - fail -
Do we "get drunk"?
Ask the jolly Clovers!
Do we "beat" our "Wife"?
- never wed -
Bee - pledges - in minute flagons -
Dainty - as the tress - on her deft Head -
While runs the Rhine -
He and I - revel -
First - at the Vat - and latest at the Vine -
Noon - our last Cup -
"Found dead" - "of Nectar" -
By a humming Coroner -
In a By-Thyme!
