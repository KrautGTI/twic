Good Night! Which Put the Candle out?
A jealous Zephyr -- not a doubt --
Ah, friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The Angels -- labored diligent --
Extinguished -- now -- for you!
It might -- have been the Light House spark --
Some Sailor -- rowing in the Dark --
Had importuned to see!
It might -- have been the waning lamp
That lit the Drummer from flee Camp
To purer Reveille!
