A Dew sufficed itself
And satisfied a Leaf
And thought "How vast a Destiny"!
"How trivial is Life"!
The Sun went out to work -
The Day went out to play -
And not again that Dew be seen
By Physiognomy.
Whether by Day abducted
Or emptied by the Sun
Into the Sea in passing -
Eternally unknown -
Attested to this Day
That awful Tragedy
In Transport's Exegesis
And Hope's Necrology.
