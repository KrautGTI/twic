Ah, Moon - and Star!
You are very far -
But - were no one farther than you -
Do you think I'd stop for a firmament -
Or a cubit - or so?
I could borrow a Bonnet - of the Lark -
And a Chamois' silver boot -
And a stirrup of an Antelope -
And leap to you - tonight!
But - Moon - and Star -
Though you're very far -
There is one - farther than you -
He - is more than a firmament - from me -
And I cannot go!
