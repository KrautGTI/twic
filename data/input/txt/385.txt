Just so - Christ - raps -
He - does'nt weary -
First at the Knocker -
And then - at the Bell -
Then - on Divinest tiptoe standing -
Might he but spy the hiding soul!
When he - retires -
Chilled - or weary -
It will be ample time for me -
Patient - opon the steps - until then -
Heart - I am knocking low
At thee!
