I think just how my shape will rise -
When I shall be -
Till Hair - and Eyes - and timid Head -
Are - in Heaven -
I think just how my lips will weigh -
With shapeless - quivering - prayer -
That you - -  -
The of your care -
I mind me that of Anguish - sent -
drifts were moved away -
Before my simple bosom - broke -
And why not - if
And so I con that thing -  -
Until - delirious - borne -
By my long bright - and  - -
I my Heart -
