No Brigadier throughout the year
So civic as the Jay -
A Neighbor and a Warrior too -
With shrill felicity
Pursuing Winds that censure us
A Febuary Day -
The Brother of the Universe
Was never blown away -
The Snow and he are intimate -
I've often seen them play
When Heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due to an insulted Sky
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
To their temerity -
The Pillow of this daring Head
Is pungent Evergreens -
His Larder - terse and militant -
Unknown - refreshing things -
His Character a Tonic,
His Future a Dispute -
Unfair an Immortality
That leaves this Neighbor out -
