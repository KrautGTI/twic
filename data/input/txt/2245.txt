To her derided Home
A Weed of Summer came -
She did not know her station low
Nor Ignominy's name -
Bestowed a summer long
Upon a fameless flower,
Then swept as lightly from disdain
As Lady from her Bower -
The implements of Bliss are few -
As Jesus says of Him -
"Come unto me" the Moiety
That wafts the Seraphim -
