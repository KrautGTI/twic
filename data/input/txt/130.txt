Flowerswell, if anybody
Can the define,
Half a transport, half a trouble,
With which flowers humble men--
Anybody find the fountain,
From which floods so contra flow,

Too much pathos in their faces,
For a simple breast like mine!
Butterflies from Domingo,
Cruising round the purple line,
Have a system of
Far superior to mine!
