I watched the Moon around the House
Until opon a Pane -
She stopped - a Traveller's privilege - for Rest -
And there opon
I gazed - as at a ,
The Lady in the Town
Doth think no incivility
To lift her Glass - opon -
But never Stranger justified
The Curiosity
Like Mine - for not a Foot - nor Hand -
Nor Formula - had she -
But like a Head - a Guillotine
Slid carelessly away -
Did independent, Amber -
Sustain her in the sky -
Or like a Stemless Flower -
Upheld in rolling Air
By finer Gravitations -
Than bind Philosopher -
No Hunger - had she - nor an Inn -
Her Toilette - to suffice -
Nor Avocation - nor Concern
For little Mysteries
As harass us - like Life - and Death -
And Afterward - or Nay -
But seemed engrossed to Absolute -
With Shining - and the Sky -
The privilege to scrutinize
Was scarce opon my Eyes
When, with a Silver practise -
She vaulted out of Gaze -
And next - I met her on a Cloud -
Myself too far below
To follow her Superior Road -
Or it's Advantage - Blue -
