The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants.
At Evening it is not -
At Morning in a Truffled Hut
It stop opon a Spot
As if it tarried always
And yet it's whole Career
Is shorter than a Snake's Delay
And fleeter than a Tare -
'Tis Vegetation's Juggler -
The Germ of Alibi -
Doth like a Bubble antedate
And like a Bubble hie -
Had Nature any Plated Face
Or could she one contemn -
Had Nature an "Iscariot" -
That Mushroom it is him.
