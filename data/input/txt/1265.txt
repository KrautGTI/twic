Dying - to be afraid of Thee -
One must to thine Artillery
Have left exposed a friend -
Than thine old Arrow is a Shot
Delivered straighter to the Heart
The leaving Love behind -
Not for itself, the Dust is shy.
But - Enemy - Beloved be -
Thy Batteries divorce -
Fight sternly in a dying eye
Two Armies, Love and Certainty,
And Love and the Reverse -
