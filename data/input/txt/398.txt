I feel the old -
I hear him ask the servant
For such an one - as me -
I take a  - as I go -
My face to -
He never me - in  -
I might his eye!
I cross the Hall with steps -
I - silent - pass the door -
I look on all this world -

We talk in  - and in -
A kind of strain -
Each - sounding - shily -
Just - how - deep -
The one - had been -
We - I leave my Dog - at home -
A Moon
Goes with us - just a little way -
And - then - we are  -
- if are "alone" -
they the
- if those "vailed faces" - be -
cannot -
On High!
I'd give - to live that hour - -
The -
But must -
for
