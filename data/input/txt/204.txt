A little Bread - A crust - a crumb -
A little trust - a demijohn -
Can keep the soul alive -
Not portly, mind! but breathing - warm -
Conscious - as old Napoleon,
The night before the crown!
A modest lot - A fame petite -
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet
Is plenty! Is enough!
A business is
A - Who asketh more,
Must seek the neighboring life!
