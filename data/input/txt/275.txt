A Wife - at Daybreak - I shall be -
Sunrise - Hast Thou a Flag for me?
At Midnight - I am yet a Maid -
How short it takes to make it Bride -
Then - Midnight - I have passed from Thee -
Unto the East - and Victory.
Midnight - Good night - I hear them Call -
The Angels bustle in the Hall -
Softly - my Future climbs the Stair -
I fumble at my Childhood's Prayer -
So soon to be a Child - no more -
Eternity - I'm coming - Sir -
Master - I've seen the Face - before -
