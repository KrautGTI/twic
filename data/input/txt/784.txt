Two Butterflies went out at Noon
And waltzed opon a Farm
And then espied Circumference
And caught a ride with him -
Then lost themselves and found themselves
In eddies of the sun
Till Rapture missed Peninsula -
And Both were wrecked in Noon -
To all surviving Butterflies
Be this Fatuity
Example - and monition
To entomology -
