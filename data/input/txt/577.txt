One need not be a Chamber - to be Haunted -
One need not be a House -
The Brain has Corridors - surpassing
Material Place -
Far safer, of a midnight meeting
External Ghost
Than it's interior confronting -
That cooler Host -
Far safer, through an Abbey gallop,
The Stones a'chase -
Than unarmed, one's a'self encounter -
In lonesome Place -
Ourself behind ourself, concealed -
Should startle most -
Assassin hid in our Apartment
Be Horror's least -
The Body - borrows a Revolver -
He bolts the Door -
O'erlooking a superior spectre -
Or More -
