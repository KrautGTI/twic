Success - is counted  sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed -
To Comprehend a Nectar -
Requires sorest need -
Not one of all the Purple Host
Who took the Flag - today -
Can tell the Definition - so clear - of Victory -
As He - defeated - dying -
On whose forbidden ear -
The distant strains of Triumph
Burst - agonized - and Clear!
