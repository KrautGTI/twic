The feet of people walking home -
With gayer sandals go -
The Crocus, till she rises
The Vassal of the snow -
The lips at Hallelujah
Long years of practise bore -
Till bye and bye, these Bargemen
Walked singing, on the shore.
Pearls are the Diver's farthings -
Extorted from the sea -
Pinions - the Seraph's wagon -
Pedestrian once - as we -
Night is the morning's Canvas -
Larceny - Legacy.
Death, but our rapt attention
To immortality.
My figures fail to tell me
How far the village lies
Whose Peasants are the angels -
Whose Cantons dot the skies -
My Classics vail their faces -
My faith that dark adores -
Which from it's solemn abbeys
Such Resurrection pours -
