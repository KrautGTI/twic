Our little Kinsmen - after Rain
In plenty may be seen,
A Pink and Pulpy multitude
The tepid Ground opon.
A needless life, it seemed to me
Until a little Bird
As to a Hospitality
Advanced and -
As I of He, so God of Me
I pondered, may have judged,
And left the little Angle Worm
With Modesties enlarged.
