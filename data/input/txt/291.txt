Victory comes late,
And is held low to freezing lips
Too rapt with frost
To mind it!
How sweet it would have tasted!
Just a drop!
God so ?
His table's spread too high
Except we dine on tiptoe!
fit such little mouths -
- suit -
The Eagle's golden breakfast -
God keep his vow to
Who of little love -
Know how to starve!
