As Watchers hang opon the East -
As Beggars revel at a feast
By savory fancy spread -
As Brooks in Deserts, babble sweet
On Ear too far for the delight -
Heaven beguiles the tired.
As that same Watcher when the East
Opens the lid of Amethyst
And lets the morning go -
That Beggar, when an honored Guest -
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed -
Heaven to us, if true.
