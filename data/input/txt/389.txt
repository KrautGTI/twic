What would I give to see his face?
I'd give - I'd give my life - of course -
But is not enough!
Stop just a minute - let me think!
I'd give my biggest Bobolink!
That makes - - and
You know who is -
I'd give -
Roses a day from Zinzebar -
And Lily tubes - like wells -
Bees - by the furlong -
Straits of Blue -
Navies of Butterflies - sailed thro' -
And dappled Cowslip Dells -
Then I have "shares" in Primrose "Banks" -
Daffodil Dowries - spicy "stocks" -
Dominions - broad as Dew -
Bags of Doubloons - adventurous Bees
Brought me - from firmamental seas -
And Purple - from Peru -
- have I bought it -
"Shylock"? Say!
Sign me the Bond!
"I vow to pay
To H r - who pledges -
- of her Sovreign's face"!
Contract!
Grace!
My of Bliss!
