The Luxury to apprehend
The Luxury 'twould be
To look at thee a single time
An Epicure of me
In whatsoever Presence makes
Till for a further Food
I scarcely recollect to starve
So first am I supplied.
The Luxury to meditate
The Luxury it was
To banquet on thy Countenance
A Sumptuousness supplies
To plainer Days whose table far
As Certainty can see
Is laden with a single Crumb
The Consciousness of thee
