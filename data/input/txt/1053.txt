The Wind begun to knead the Grass
As Women do a Dough -
He flung a Hand full at the Plain
A Hand full at the Sky.
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees
And started all abroad -
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands
And throw away the Road -
The Wagons quickened on the Streets -
The Thunder gossiped low
The lightning showed a yellow Head
And then a livid Toe -
The Birds put up the Bars to nests -
The Cattle flung to Barns
Then came one drop of Giant Rain
And then as if the Hands
That held the Dams had parted hold -
The Waters Wrecked the Sky -
But overlooked my Father's House
Just quartering a Tree -
