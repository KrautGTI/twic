Heart not so heavy as mine
Wending late home -
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune -
A careless snatch - a ballad -
A Ditty of the street -
Yet to my irritated ear
An anodyne so sweet -
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled and mused, and carolled -
Then bubbled slow away -
It was as if a chirping brook
Opon a toilsome way
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why -
Tomorrow - night will come again -
Perhaps - tired and sore -
Oh Bugle, by the window
I pray you stroll once more!
