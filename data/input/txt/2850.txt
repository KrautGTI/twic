It's Coming -- the postponeless Creature --
It gains the Block -- and now -- it gains the Door --
Chooses it's latch, from all the other fastenings --
Enters -- wide a "You know Me -- Sir"?
Simple Salute -- and Certain Recognition --
Bold -- were it Enemy -- Brief -- were it friend --
Dresses each House in Crape, and Icicle --
And Carries one -- out of it -- to God --
