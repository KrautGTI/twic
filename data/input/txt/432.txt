It sifts from Leaden Sieves -
It powders all the Wood -
It fills with Alabaster Wool
The Wrinkles of the Road -
It scatters like the Birds -
Condenses like a Flock -
Like Juggler's Figures situates
Upon a baseless Arc -
It traverses yet halts -
Disperses as it stays -
Then curls itself in Capricorn -
Denying that it was -
