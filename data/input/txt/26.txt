The feet of people walking home
With gayer sandals go -
The Crocus - till she rises
The Vassal of the snow -
The lips at Hallelujah
Long years of practise bore
Till bye and bye these Bargemen
Walked singing on the shore.
Pearls are the Diver's farthings
Extorted from the sea -
Pinions - the Seraph's wagon
Pedestrian once - as we -
Night is the morning's Canvas
Larceny - legacy -
Death, but our rapt attention
To Immortality.
My figures fail to tell me
How far the village lies -
Whose peasants are the angels -
Whose Cantons dot the skies -
My Classics vail their faces -
My faith that Dark adores -
Which from it's solemn abbeys
Such resurrection pours.
