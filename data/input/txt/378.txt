I came to buy a smile - today -
But just a single smile -
The smallest one opon your cheek -
Will suit me just as well -
The one that no one else would miss
It shone so very small -
I'm pleading at the counter - sir -
Could you afford to sell?
I've Diamonds - on my fingers!
You know what Diamonds - are!
I've Rubies - like the Evening Blood -
And Topaz - like the star!
'Twould be a bargain for a Jew!
Say? May I have it - Sir?
