			The Robin's my Criterion for Tune -<br>
			Because I grow - where Robins do -<br>
			But, were I Cuckoo born -<br>
			I'd swear by him -<br>
			The ode familiar - rules the Noon -<br>
			The Buttercup's, my whim for Bloom -<br>
			Because, we're Orchard sprung -<br>
			But, were I Britain born,<br>
			I'd Daisies spurn -<br>
			None but the Nut - October fit -<br>
			Because - through dropping it,<br>
			The Seasons flit - I'm taught -<br>
			Without the Snow's Tableau<br>
			Winter, were lie - to me -<br>
			Because I see - New Englandly -<br>
			The Queen, discerns like me -<br>
			Provincially -<br>
