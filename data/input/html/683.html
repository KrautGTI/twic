			The Wind did'nt come from the Orchard - today -<br>
			Further than that -<br>
			Nor stop to play with the Hay -<br>
			Nor threaten a Hat -<br>
			He's a transitive fellow - very -<br>
			Rely on that -<br>
			If He leave a Bur at the door<br>
			We know He has climbed a Fir -<br>
			But the Fir is Where - Declare -<br>
			Were you ever there?<br>
			If He bring Odors of Clovers -<br>
			And that is His business - not Our's -<br>
			Then He has been with the Mowers -<br>
			Whetting away the Hours<br>
			To sweet pauses of Hay -<br>
			His Way - of a June Day -<br>
			If He fling Sand, and Pebble -<br>
			Little Hats - and stubble -<br>
			With an occasional steeple -<br>
			And a hoarse "Get out of the Way, I say",<br>
			Who'd be the fool to stay?<br>
			Would you - Say -<br>
			Would you be the fool to stay?<br>
