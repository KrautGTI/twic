			Drama's Vitallest Expression is the Common Day<br>
			That arise and set about Us -<br>
			Other Tragedy<br>
			Perish in the Recitation -<br>
			This - the best enact<br>
			When the Audience is scattered<br>
			And the Boxes shut -<br>
			"Hamlet" to Himself were Hamlet -<br>
			Had not Shakespeare wrote -<br>
			Though the "Romeo" left no Record<br>
			Of his Juliet,<br>
			It were infinite enacted<br>
			In the Human Heart -<br>
			Only Theatre recorded<br>
			Owner cannot shut -<br>
