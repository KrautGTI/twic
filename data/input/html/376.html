			I've known a Heaven, like a Tent -<br>
			To wrap it's shining Yards -<br>
			Pluck up it's stakes, and disappear -<br>
			Without the sound of Boards<br>
			Or Rip of Nail - Or Carpenter -<br>
			But just the miles of Stare -<br>
			That signalize a Show's Retreat -<br>
			In North America -<br>
			No Trace - no Figment - of the Thing<br>
			That dazzled, Yesterday,<br>
			No Ring - no Marvel -<br>
			Men, and Feats -<br>
			Dissolved as utterly -<br>
			As Bird's far Navigation<br>
			Discloses just a Hue -<br>
			A plash of Oars, a Gaiety -<br>
			Then swallowed up, of View.<br>
