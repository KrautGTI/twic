			The <span title="Topic 72"><font color="#8094e8"><b>birds</b></font></span> <span title="Topic 45"><font color="#14ff50"><b>begun</b></font></span> at four o'clock<br>
			Their period for dawn<br>
			A music numerous as space<br>
			And neighboring as noon -<br>
			I could not count their force<br>
			Their numbers did expend<br>
			As brook by brook bestows itself<br>
			To multiply the pond<br>
			Their listener was not<br>
			Except occasional man<br>
			In homely industry arrayed<br>
			To overtake the<br>
			Nor was it for applause<br>
			That I could ascertain<br>
			But independent extasy<br>
			Of universe and men.<br>
			By six the flood had done<br>
			No tumult there had been<br>
			Of dressing, or departure -<br>
			Yet all the band was gone.<br>
			The sun engrossed the east -<br>
			The day resumed the world -<br>
			The miracle that introduced -<br>
			Forgotten - as fulfilled.<br>
