			As lately as to-day.<br>
			I know it by the numb look<br>
			Such houses have alway.<br>
			The neighbors rustle in and out,<br>
			The doctor drives away.<br>
			A window opens like a pod,<br>
			Abrupt, mechanically;<br>
			Somebody flings a mattress out,<br>
			The children hurry by;<br>
			They wonder if It died on that,<br>
			I used to when a boy.<br>
			The minister goes stiffly in<br>
			As if the house were his,<br>
			And he owned all the mourners now,<br>
			And little boys besides;<br>
			And then the milliner, and the man<br>
			Of the appalling trade,<br>
			To take the measure of the house.<br>
			There'll be that dark parade<br>
			Of tassels and of coaches soon;<br>
			It's easy as a sign,<br>
			The intuition of the news<br>
			In just a country town.<br>
