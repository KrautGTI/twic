			OLD-FASHIONED.<br>
			Arcturus is his other name,<br>
			I'd rather call him star!<br>
			It's so unkind of science<br>
			To go and interfere!<br>
			I pull a flower from the woods,<br>
			A monster with a glass<br>
			Computes the stamens in a breath,<br>
			And has her in a class.<br>
			Whereas I took the butterfly<br>
			Aforetime in my hat,<br>
			He sits erect in cabinets,<br>
			The clover-bells forgot.<br>
			What once was heaven, is zenith now.<br>
			Where I proposed to go<br>
			When time's brief masquerade was done,<br>
			Is mapped, and charted too!<br>
			What if the poles should frisk about<br>
			And stand upon their heads!<br>
			I hope I 'm ready for the worst,<br>
			Whatever prank betides!<br>
			Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!<br>
			I hope the children there<br>
			Won't be new-fashioned when I come,<br>
			And laugh at me, and stare!<br>
			I hope the father in the skies<br>
			Will lift his little girl,<br>
			Old-fashioned, naughty, everything,<br>
			Over the stile of pearl!<br>
