			He <span title="Topic 73"><font color="#6880ff"><b>fought</b></font></span> like those Who've nought to lose -<br>
			Bestowed Himself to Balls<br>
			As One who for a further Life<br>
			Had not a further Use -<br>
			Invited Death - with bold attempt -<br>
			But Death was Coy of Him<br>
			As Other Men, were Coy of Death.<br>
			To Him - to live - was Doom -<br>
			His Comrades, shifted like the Flakes<br>
			When Gusts reverse the Snow -<br>
			But He - was left alive Because<br>
			Of Greediness to die -<br>
