			There came a <span title="Topic 38"><font color="#f0ff84"><b>day</b></font></span> - at Summer's full -<br>
			Entirely for me -<br>
			I thought that such were for the Saints -<br>
			Where Resurrections - be -<br>
			The Sun - as common - went abroad -<br>
			The Flowers - accustomed - blew -<br>
			As if no soul - that solstice passed -<br>
			Which maketh all things - new -<br>
			The time was scarce profaned - by speech -<br>
			The falling of a word<br>
			Was needless - as at Sacrament -<br>
			The - of Our Lord!<br>
			Each was to each - the sealed Church -<br>
			Permitted to commune -  time -<br>
			Lest we too awkward show -<br>
			At supper of "the Lamb."<br>
			The hours slid fast - as hours will -<br>
			Clutched tight - by greedy hands -<br>
			So - faces on two Decks - look back -<br>
			Bound to - lands.<br>
			And so when all the time had leaked -<br>
			Without external sound -<br>
			Each bound the other's Crucifix -<br>
			We gave no other Bond -<br>
			Sufficient Troth - that we shall  -<br>
			Deposed - at length the Grave -<br>
			To that new - -<br>
			- through Calvaries - of Love!<br>
