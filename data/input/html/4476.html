			Going to <span title="Topic 50"><font color="#78ffae"><b>heaven!
</b></font></span><br>
			I don't know when,<br>
			Pray do not ask me how,<br>
			Indeed, I 'm too astonished<br>
			To think of answering you!<br>
			Going to heaven!<br>
			How dim it sounds!<br>
			And yet it will be done<br>
			As sure as flocks go home at night<br>
			Unto the shepherd's arm!<br>
			Perhaps you 're going too!<br>
			Who knows?<br>
			If you should get there first,<br>
			Save just a little place for me<br>
			Close to the two I lost!<br>
			The smallest "robe" will fit me,<br>
			And just a bit of "crown;"<br>
			For you know we do not mind our dress<br>
			When we are going home.<br>
			I 'm glad I don't believe it,<br>
			For it would stop my breath,<br>
			And I 'd like to look a little more<br>
			At such a curious earth!<br>
			I am glad they did believe it<br>
			Whom I have never found<br>
			Since the mighty autumn afternoon<br>
			I left them in the ground.<br>
