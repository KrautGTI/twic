			You've seen Balloons set - Hav'nt You?<br>
			So stately they ascend -<br>
			It is as Swans - discarded You,<br>
			For Duties Diamond -<br>
			Their Liquid Feet go softly out<br>
			Opon a Sea of Blonde -<br>
			They spurn the Air, as 'twere too mean<br>
			For Creatures so renowned -<br>
			Their Ribbons just beyond the eye -<br>
			They struggle - some - for Breath -<br>
			And yet the Crowd applaud, below -<br>
			They would not encore - Death -<br>
			The Gilded Creature strains - and spins -<br>
			Trips frantic in a Tree -<br>
			Tears open her imperial Veins -<br>
			And tumbles in the Sea -<br>
			The Crowd - retire with an Oath -<br>
			The Dust in Streets - go down -<br>
			And Clerks in Counting Rooms<br>
			Observe - "'Twas only a Balloon" -<br>
