			THE WlND'S VISIT.<br>
			The wind tapped like a tired man,<br>
			And like a host, "Come in,"<br>
			I boldly answered; entered then<br>
			My residence within<br>
			A rapid, footless guest,<br>
			To offer whom a chair<br>
			Were as impossible as hand<br>
			A sofa to the air.<br>
			No bone had he to bind him,<br>
			His speech was like the push<br>
			Of numerous humming-birds at once<br>
			From a superior bush.<br>
			His countenance a billow,<br>
			His fingers, if he pass,<br>
			Let go a music, as of tunes<br>
			Blown tremulous in glass.<br>
			He visited, still flitting;<br>
			Then, like a timid man,<br>
			Again he tapped  't was flurriedly<br>
			And I became alone.<br>
