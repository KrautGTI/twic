			You'll know it - as you know 'tis Noon -<br>
			By Glory -<br>
			As you do the Sun -<br>
			By Glory -<br>
			As you will in Heaven -<br>
			Know God the Father - and the Son.<br>
			By intuition, Mightiest Things<br>
			Assert themselves - and not by terms -<br>
			"I'm Midnight" - need the Midnight say -<br>
			"I'm Sunrise" - Need the Majesty?<br>
			Omnipotence - had not a Tongue -<br>
			His lisp - is Lightning - and the Sun -<br>
			His Conversation - with the Sea -<br>
			"How shall you know"?<br>
			Consult your Eye!<br>
