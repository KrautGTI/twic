				NATURE'S CHANGES<br>

			The springtime's pallid landscape<br>
			Will glow like bright bouquet,<br>
			Though drifted deep in parian<br>
			The village lies to-day.<br>
			The lilacs, bending many a year,<br>
			With purple load will hang;<br>
			The bees will not forget the tune<br>
			Their old forefathers sang.<br>
			The rose will redden in the bog,<br>
			The aster on the hill<br>
			Her everlasting fashion set,<br>
			And covenant gentians frill,<br>
			Till summer folds her miracle<br>
			As women do their gown,<br>
			Or priests adjust the symbols<br>
			When sacrament is done.<br>
