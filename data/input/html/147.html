			A something in a summer's Day<br>
			As slow her flambeaux burn away<br>
			Which solemnizes me.<br>
			A something in a summer's noon -<br>
			A depth - an Azure - a perfume -<br>
			Transcending extasy.<br>
			And still within a summer's night<br>
			A something so transporting bright<br>
			I clap my hands to see -<br>
			Then vail my too inspecting face<br>
			Lest such a subtle - shimmering grace<br>
			Flutter too far for me -<br>
			The wizard fingers never rest -<br>
			The purple brook within the breast<br>
			Still chafes it's narrow bed -<br>
			Still rears the East her amber Flag -<br>
			Guides still the sun along the Crag<br>
			His Caravan of Red -<br>
			So looking on - the night - the morn<br>
			Conclude the wonder gay -<br>
			And I meet, coming thro' the dews<br>
			Another summer's Day!<br>
