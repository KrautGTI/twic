			The first Day's Night had come -<br>
			And grateful that a thing<br>
			So terrible - had been endured -<br>
			I told my Soul to sing -<br>
			She said her strings were snapt -<br>
			Her Bow - to atoms blown -<br>
			And so to mend her - gave me work<br>
			Until another Morn -<br>
			And then - a <span title="Topic 95"><font color="#e458ff"><b>Day</b></font></span> as huge<br>
			As Yesterdays in pairs,<br>
			Unrolled it's horror in my face -<br>
			Until it blocked my eyes -<br>
			My Brain - begun to laugh -<br>
			I mumbled - like a fool -<br>
			And tho' 'tis Years ago - that Day -<br>
			My Brain keeps giggling - still.<br>
			And Something's odd - within -<br>
			That person that I was -<br>
			And this One - do not feel the same -<br>
			Could it be Madness - this?<br>
