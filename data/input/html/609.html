			If I may have it, when it's <span title="Topic 5"><font color="#6c48b4"><b>dead,
</b></font></span><br>
			I'll be contented - so -<br>
			If just as soon as Breath is out<br>
			It shall belong to me -<br>
			Until they lock it in the Grave,<br>
			'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh -<br>
			For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,<br>
			Myself - can own the key -<br>
			Think of it Lover! I and Thee<br>
			Permitted - face to face to be -<br>
			After a Life - a Death - we'll say -<br>
			For Death was That -<br>
			And This - is Thee -<br>
			I'll tell Thee All - how Bald it grew -<br>
			How Midnight felt, at first - to me -<br>
			How all the Clocks stopped in the World -<br>
			And Sunshine pinched me - 'Twas so cold -<br>
			Then how the Grief got sleepy - some -<br>
			As if my soul were deaf and dumb -<br>
			Just making signs - across - to Thee -<br>
			That this way - thou could'st  notice me -<br>
			I'll tell you how I tried to keep<br>
			A smile, to show you, when this Deep<br>
			All Waded - We look back for Play,<br>
			At those Old Times - in Calvary.<br>
			Forgive me, if the Grave come slow -<br>
			For Coveting to look at Thee -<br>
			Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost<br>
			Outvisions Paradise!<br>
