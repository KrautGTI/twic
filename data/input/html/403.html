			Going to Him! <span title="Topic 47"><font color="#e89cff"><b>Happy</b></font></span> <span title="Topic 47"><font color="#e89cff"><b>letter!
</b></font></span><br>
			Tell Him -<br>
			Tell Him the <span title="Topic 47"><font color="#e89cff"><b>page</b></font></span> I did'nt write -<br>
			Tell Him - I only said the Syntax -<br>
			And left the Verb and the pronoun - out -<br>
			Tell Him just how the fingers hurried -<br>
			Then - how they waded - slow - slow -<br>
			And then you wished you had eyes in your pages -<br>
			So you could see what moved them so -<br>
			Tell Him - it was'nt a Practised Writer -<br>
			You guessed - from the way the sentence toiled -<br>
			You could hear the Boddice tug, behind you -<br>
			As if it held but the might of a child -<br>
			You almost pitied it - you - it worked so -<br>
			Tell Him - No - you may quibble there -<br>
			For it would split His Heart, to know it -<br>
			And then you and I, were silenter.<br>
			Tell Him - Night finished - before we finished -<br>
			And the Old Clock kept neighing "Day"!<br>
			And you - got sleepy -<br>
			And begged to be ended -<br>
			What would it hinder so - to - say?<br>
			Tell Him - just how she sealed you - Cautious!<br>
			But - if He ask where you are hid<br>
			Until tomorrow - Happy letter!<br>
			Gesture Coquette - and shake your Head!<br>
