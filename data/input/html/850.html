			Did you ever <span title="Topic 99"><font color="#b8c0ff"><b>stand</b></font></span> in a Cavern's Mouth -<br>
			Widths out of the Sun -<br>
			And look - and shudder, and block your breath -<br>
			And deem to be alone<br>
			In such a place, what horror,<br>
			How Goblin it would be -<br>
			And fly, as 'twere pursuing you?<br>
			Then Loneliness - looks so -<br>
			Did you ever look in a Cannon's face -<br>
			Between whose Yellow eye -<br>
			And your's - the Judgment intervened -<br>
			The Question of "To die" -<br>
			Extemporizing in your ear<br>
			As cool as Satyr's Drums -<br>
			If you remember, and were saved<br>
			It's liker so - it seems -<br>
