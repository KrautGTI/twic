			I've dropped my Brain - My Soul is numb -<br>
			The Veins that used to run<br>
			Stop palsied - 'tis Paralysis<br>
			Done perfecter in stone -<br>
			Vitality is Carved and cool -<br>
			My nerve in marble lies -<br>
			A Breathing Woman<br>
			Yesterday - endowed with Paradise.<br>
			Not dumb - I had a sort that moved -<br>
			A Sense that smote and stirred -<br>
			Instincts for Dance - a caper part -<br>
			An Aptitude for Bird -<br>
			Who wrought Carrara in me<br>
			And chiselled all my tune<br>
			Were it a witchcraft - were it Death -<br>
			I've still a chance to strain<br>
			To Being, somewhere - Motion - Breath -<br>
			Though Centuries beyond,<br>
			And every limit a Decade -<br>
			I'll shiver, satisfied.<br>
