			I've none to tell me to but Thee<br>
			So when Thou failest, nobody -<br>
			It was a little tie -<br>
			It just held Two, nor those it held<br>
			Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled<br>
			Beyond my Boundary -<br>
			If things were opposite - and Me<br>
			And Me it were, that ebbed from Thee<br>
			On some unanswering Shore -<br>
			Would'st Thou seek so - just say<br>
			That I the Answer may pursue<br>
			Unto the lips it eddied through -<br>
			So - overtaking Thee -<br>
