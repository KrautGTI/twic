			I'm "wife" - I've finished that -<br>
			That other state -<br>
			I'm Czar - I'm "Woman" now -<br>
			It's safer so -<br>
			How odd the Girl's life looks<br>
			Behind this soft Eclipse -<br>
			I think that Earth feels so<br>
			To folks in Heaven - now -<br>
			This being comfort - then<br>
			That other kind - was pain -<br>
			But Why compare?<br>
			I'm "Wife"! Stop there!<br>
