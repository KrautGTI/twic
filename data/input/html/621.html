			You'll find - it when you try to die -<br>
			The easier to let go -<br>
			For recollecting such as went -<br>
			You could not spare - you know.<br>
			And though their places somewhat filled -<br>
			As did their Marble names<br>
			With Moss - they never grew so full -<br>
			You chose the newer names -<br>
			And when this World - sets further back -<br>
			As Dying - say it does -<br>
			The former love - distincter grows -<br>
			And supersedes the fresh -<br>
			And Thought of them - so fair invites -<br>
			It looks too tawdry Grace<br>
			To stay behind - with just the Toys<br>
			We bought - to ease their place -<br>
