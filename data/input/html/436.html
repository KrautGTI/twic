			Savior! I've no one else to tell -<br>
			And so I trouble<br>
			I am the one forgot thee so -<br>
			Dost thou remember me?<br>
			Nor, for myself, I came so far -<br>
			That were the little load -<br>
			I brought thee the imperial Heart<br>
			I had not strength to hold -<br>
			The Heart I carried in my own -<br>
			Till mine too heavy grew -<br>
			Yet - strangest - since it went -<br>
			Is it too large for<br>
