			I'll tell you how the Sun rose -<br>
			A Ribbon at a time!<br>
			The Steeples swam in Amethyst!<br>
			The news like squirrels ran!<br>
			The hills untied their Bonnets!<br>
			The Bobolinks begun!<br>
			Then I said softly to myself<br>
			"That must have been the sun"!<br>
			But how he I know not!<br>
			There seemed a purple stile<br>
			Which little yellow boys and girls<br>
			Were Climbing all the while -<br>
			Till when they reached the other side,<br>
			A Dominie in gray<br>
			Put gently up the evening bars<br>
			And led the flock away!<br>
