			A THUNDER-STORM.<br>
			The wind begun to rock the grass<br>
			With threatening tunes and low,<br>
			He flung a menace at the earth,<br>
			A menace at the sky.<br>
			The leaves unhooked themselves from trees<br>
			And started all abroad;<br>
			The dust did scoop itself like hands<br>
			And throw away the road.<br>
			The wagons quickened on the streets,<br>
			The thunder hurried slow;<br>
			The lightning showed a yellow beak,<br>
			And then a livid claw.<br>
			The birds put up the bars to nests,<br>
			The cattle fled to barns;<br>
			There came one drop of giant rain,<br>
			And then, as if the hands<br>
			That held the dams had parted hold,<br>
			The waters wrecked the sky,<br>
			But overlooked my father's house,<br>
			Just quartering a tree.<br>
