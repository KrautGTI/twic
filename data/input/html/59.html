			I hav'nt told my garden yet -<br>
			Lest that should conquer me.<br>
			I hav'nt quite the strength now<br>
			To break it to the Bee -<br>
			I will not name it in the street<br>
			For shops w'd stare at me -<br>
			That one so shy - so ignorant<br>
			Should have the face to die.<br>
			The hillsides must not know it -<br>
			Where I have rambled so -<br>
			Nor tell the loving forests<br>
			The day that I shall go -<br>
			Nor lisp it at the table -<br>
			Nor by the way<br>
			Hint that within the Riddle<br>
			One will walk today -<br>
