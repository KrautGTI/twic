			You'll know Her - by Her Foot -<br>
			The smallest Gamboge Hand<br>
			With Fingers - where the Toes should be -<br>
			Would more affront the sand -<br>
			Than this Quaint Creature's Boot -<br>
			Adjusted by a stem -<br>
			Without a Button - I c'd vouch -<br>
			Unto a Velvet Limb -<br>
			You'll know Her - by Her Vest -<br>
			Tight fitting - Orange - Brown -<br>
			Inside a Jacket duller -<br>
			She wore when she was born -<br>
			Her Cap is small - and snug -<br>
			Constructed for the Winds -<br>
			She'd pass for Barehead - short way off -<br>
			But as she closer stands -<br>
			So finer 'tis than Wool -<br>
			You cannot feel the seam -<br>
			Nor is it clasped unto of Band -<br>
			Nor held opon - of Brim -<br>
			You'll know Her - by Her Voice -<br>
			At first - a doubtful Tone -<br>
			A sweet endeavor - but as March<br>
			To April - hurries on -<br>
			She squanders on your Head<br>
			Such Threnodies of Pearl -<br>
			You beg the Robin in your Brain<br>
			To keep the other - still -<br>
