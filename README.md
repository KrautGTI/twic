<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for trying out **"Topic Words in Context"** - or **"TWiC"**, for short.  
<br/>
TWiC is a data visualization created by [Jonathan Armoza](http://www.twitter.com/jonathangrams) that provides hierarchical, top-down and bottom-up views of LDA topic models generated by the popular topic modeler, [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu).  
<br/>
TWiC was born out of the need for digital humanities researchers to understand how the topic word list outputs from topic modelers like MALLET relate to the texts they attempt to model.  
<br/>
In order to do so, the visualization presents users with multiple, related views that portray how topics are distributed throughout the entire collection of texts being modeled, looking from all the way above - the "big data" view - and diving downward to where topic words are situated in their original contexts in the texts themselves. Each successive view as one browses the visualization is then considered part of the larger whole of the previous view, or to put it another way, a subset of texts "underneath" the previous view.

<br/>
<br/>
<font style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; font-family: Archer;">Topic Bullseyes</font>
<br/>
<table border="0" align="center"><tr><td><img src="/Users/PeregrinePickle/Documents/Programming/D3Playground/projects/twic/docs/images/twic_bullseye.png" width="350" height="350"/></td></tr></table>


<br/>
Above is one of the primary means by which topic distribution is visualized in TWiC: a bullseye-like abstraction of the top N topics of the texts being represented. In the image above, this would represent the top 10 topics of a group of texts. Each ring represents a topic and is given a randomly assigned and unique color.  Moving inward from the outside of the shape toward the center, more significant topics are represented, until one arrives at the center, or, the top topic.

<br/>
<br/>
<font style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; font-family: Archer;">Topic Rectangles</font>
<br/>
<table border="0" align="center"><tr><td><img src="/Users/PeregrinePickle/Documents/Programming/D3Playground/projects/twic/docs/images/twic_rectangle.png" width="200" height="400"/></td></tr></table>


<br/>
The other primary shape in TWiC is the topic rectangle, a shape that utilizes the same paradigm as the topic bullseye, where outer rings (in this case, outer rectangles) represent the top N topics of an individual text. In the image above, this would represent the top 5 topics of one text. At the center of the topic rectangle is a miniature, programmatically-derived (and truncated) view of the text itself and its topic words, each word represented by colored squares among the initial lines of the text. Uncolored words (in a light goldenrod) are words that have been ignored by MALLET.

<font style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; font-family: Archer;">Panels</font>
<br/>
<br/>

TWiC presents users with a research environment for examining topic models that consists of several graphical and informational panels. Graphical panels present TWiC's data shapes and their relationships to one another in the model and context of the collection. Informational panels show metadata about those shapes, like the topic word lists themselves and their proportions throughout the various views/levels of the collection. Graphical panels also reveal information about each other as well. With several on the screen, by mousing over data shapes and double-clicking to open underlying views, the user can not only understand the distribution of topics at a particular viewing height in the collection, but also the relation between the topic distribution as seen in those two or more vantages.
